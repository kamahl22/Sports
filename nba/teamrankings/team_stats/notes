Can you update nba_teams_ats.py, nba_teams_ou.py, and nba_teams_wins.py to do what team_overall_stats.py does? By this I mean how team_overall_stats creates a folder for each team with a script and in those team folders I want a coressponding script created. For example teams_ats_stats.py creates folder for all nba teams, timberwolves folder will have timberwolves_ats_stats.py in it
