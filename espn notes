Can you create a script that will web scrape the data for player stats listed on espn website. This is an example of what thee link would look likr https://www.espn.com/nba/player/splits/_/id/4594268/anthony-edwards. The script you created above gets the info of each player on each roster. I want this new one to create a new script for each player, overwriting the old one if there is one already existing?
