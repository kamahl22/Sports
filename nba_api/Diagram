[User Interaction Layer]
    |
    | (User Query: "Will the Suns beat the Lakers tonight?")
    v
[Chatbot Interface]
    | (Processes user query, routes to appropriate module)
    | (e.g., Game Outcome Prediction, Player Prop Prediction)
    v
[Prediction Engine]
    | (Selects appropriate model based on query type)
    | (e.g., Game Outcome Model, Player Prop Model)
    | (Fetches real-time data if needed)
    v
[Machine Learning Models]
    | (Trained models for game outcomes, point spreads, player props)
    | (e.g., XGBoost for game outcomes, Neural Network for player props)
    | (Inputs: Processed features from Data Processing Layer)
    | (Outputs: Predictions with confidence scores)
    v
[Data Processing Layer]
    | (Feature engineering, data aggregation, real-time updates)
    | (Inputs: Historical and real-time data from Data Collection Layer)
    | (Outputs: Features like team net rating, player averages, etc.)
    v
[Data Collection Layer]
    | (Fetches data from APIs: NBA API for now, extensible to NFL, MLB, etc.)
    | (Historical Data: LeagueGameFinder, PlayerGameLog, etc.)
    | (Real-Time Data: Scoreboard, PlayByPlay, etc.)
    | (Static Data: CommonAllPlayers, CommonTeamRoster, etc.)
    v
[Data Storage Layer]
    | (Stores raw data, processed features, and model outputs)
    | (e.g., SQLite for raw data, Redis for real-time caching)
    | (Ensures quick access for predictions and updates)
